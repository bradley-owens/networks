# Networks

## Introduction

Networks is an application built for developers to create an account and network through other possible developers in a more casual respect compared to LinkedIn.

## How it Works

Throughout this application users can create an account using their email, pin, name and their programming language.
Once created the user can then sign in with that acccount or sign in as guest and network through other users. Once creating the account initially, the user will the provide other details that can be shown on their profile such as: education (Degree, self taught or bootcamp), where they work, if they are looking, if they know someone hiring and contact information such as linkedIn if they want to chat.

## What is displayed

Throughout the application the user will recieve data such as:

    - Their own profile with data they can enter to be shown to other users.
    - Other users that joined networks with their chosen information.

## Tech Stack

The tech stack used throughout this application is:

    - HTML
    - CSS
    - ReactJS

This application was built using ReactJS and multiple hooks to maintain state throughout. This being a more complex application the use of redux and redux toolkit was needed throughout the create account, sign in and sign in as guest components.
